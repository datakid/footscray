=====================
Welcome to Footscray!
=====================

In the House
============

- Please water the plants
- Please make it your home
- Towels are in the upstairs bathroom drawers
- Linen is in the chest at the end of the bed
- eat/drink anything in the cupboards
- back door sometimes needs a wiggle.
- please water the plants (upstairs: bathroom, study; downstairs: front and 
  back yard) Don't worry if something dies. It's a plant.
- even if it's been raining, please check garden bed under kitchen window - 
  it's protected from sun and rain just a little too well.
- Cleaning stuff in laundry cupboard, but don't go too crazy. HOLIDAY.
- We don't have a favourite bathroom.
- Sleep in either room.
- light will filter into master bedroom from study and second bedroom in the 
  morning unless you close their curtians, or the door, or get up before the 
  sun.
- Bins out on Thursday night.
- If you cook, there is a bokashi bin in the garage (behind the door) and a 
  worm farm (near the roller door) for your food waste. Bokashi can take 
  protein and onions etc. Bokashi mix in blue lidded box next to bokashi bin.

- Next door is Stuart and Dooreen and their grown children Eric, Ashley and 
  Pearly. They are super friendly and helpful - great neighbours. Stuart is a 
  rower, and often gets up before sun to row. He is a used car salesman, so
  there are lots of cars all over the place. You can use the carpark or the 
  driveway as you need, but if there's a car in the spot, just knock on their
  door and ask them to move one.

Restaurants

Indian
------

(West Footscray is a 25 minute walk, a $10 cab ride)

- Aangan - excellent Indian restaurant in West Footscray. Recommended.

  - http://aangan.com.au/west-footscray-menu/
  - menu on fridge

- Dosa Hut
  - http://www.dosahut.net.au/our-locations/dosa-hut-footscray/

- Dosa Corner - good Dosa in West Footscray, across the road from each other
  - http://www.thedosacorner.com.au/
  

Cafes
-----

- Hey Zeus - in Footscray Market, across the road from Foostray Station bike
  racks. Best Coffee in the area, consistently. Almond milk and Soy 
  available. Not open on Sundays. Recommended.

- Footscray Milking Station - acceptable coffee, breakfast/lunch. Veggie 
  options. Open 7 days. Footscray, other side of the train line.
   
- Happy River Cafe - a little further along from the Milking Station. A real
  "wholefoods" vibe. Coffee is ok, food comes in quantity and is standard 90s
  cafe fare.
   
- The French Baguette - a large Vietnamese bakery. Coffee is passable. Lots of
  cakes etc. Open 365 days. Does Vietnamese Rolls, but not tofu ones.
  Corner of Albert and Barkly St, Footscray.

- Rudimentary. Very (too) hip. Coffee is so-so - never consitent. Once I've 
  had great coffee, three times it's been appalling. Also: very weak 
  vegetarian options and a "no changes to menu" policy. Avoid, included for 
  completeness.
   
- Advieh/Little Advi. One (Advi) in Yarraville proper, one halfway between YV
  and Seddon. Hugely busy, fantastic food, lots of options, fantastic 
  coffee. Recommended. Middle Eastern vibe, veggie and vegan well catered
  https://www.advieh.com.au/
    
- Lady Moustache. Across the road from Advieh in Gamon St. Also has good 
  coffee and an excellent, veggie friendly, menu. Local people, great vibe. A
  Latin American vibe to the food. http://www.ladymoustache.com.au/

- Yarraville central has lots of food and cafes. We also like The Cornershop
  cafe across from the Sun Cinema.
   
   
Other assorted
--------------

Pizza: Domenicos. Menu is on the fridge, great pizza. From the Gourment section:
        I like the Garden Vego, Fiona doesn't. We both like The Florentine, 
        Tuscan Style, Gourmet Margarita. Their garlic pizza is also good, with 
        or without cheese, and the plain Margarita. They deliver, every day 
        except Monday. Menu on fridge.

Vietnamese: Hao Phong 136 Hopkins Street, Footscray. Recommend: Cheap and 
        Cheerful, fast service. Vietnamese coleslaw with Tofu; salt and pepper 
        tofu; Clay hotpot with tofu and vegetables ( we have it with black 
        bean, rice is crunchy from being baked onto bottom of pot, #65). Also try 
        the Fresh Lemon Juice with Soda (#170) or the iced vietnamese coffee 
        (#177 or #178). Closed on Wednesdays.

Vietnamese: Sapa Hills. A little more expensive, and a little more inventive, 
        than Hao Phong. Super tasty. Sometimes a little too clever and can get 
        busy.

Vietnamese Bakery: There are two on Hopkins near the top end of Leeds st. Both 
        do a decent tofu vietnamese roll. I prefer the one next to the duck 
        restaurant. Both do a decent iced Vietnamese coffee too.
        
Ethiopian: Cafe Lalibela. Ethiopian is very vegan friendly and the Vegetarian 
        platter for two is excellent. Super cheap for what you get. Can take a 
        while to be served if you ime it wrong - watch for big tables and order
        before them!
        
Vegan Tacos: The Reverence Hotel on Tuesday nights does $3 vegan tacos. Short 
        walk on the other side of the station/tracks.
        
Lentil as Anything: For your pay what you want veggie meal. Barkley St. 


Bars and the etc
----------------

Dancing Dog Cafe: Lots of tiny rooms, nice atmosphere. A little grungy. Near 
    Lalibela/Coles/Footscray Station.
    
Josphines: further along Barkley st, near Domenicos pizza (you can get the 
    pizza delivered to the bar!). Brand spanking new, great range of beers, 
    lovely atmosphere. A little more mature than the Dog.

Littlefoot bar: closer to Footscray central than Josephines, on Barkley. Nice 
    enough, has a little jazz corner or acoustic bands sometimes. Acceptable
    but prefer Josephines.

Back Alley Sally: does both Pizza and bar. Back alley vibe. Near station, other
    side of tracks.

Reverence: old school pub style with meals and bands and big beer garden. Other
    side of tracks.
    
Markets
-------

- Footscray Market is groovy, only has one deli though. Closed on Sundays, 
   although the green grocer directly across from the station is 7 days and 
   open til 6pm. It's veggies are cheap - but you really need to use them in 
   48 hours or less; or freeze them.
   
- IGA on the corner of Ballarat Rd and Gordon road (3 minute walk from house) 
   is relatively comprehensive if a little expensive. Note that their veggies 
   are *terrible*.
   
- Coles in Footscray, 4 mins from station. 

- there is a fancy pants supermarket in Yarraville, and a much bigger and 
   better IGA.
